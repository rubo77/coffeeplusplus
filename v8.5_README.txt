Coffee++Layout
-------------------
(beta version 8.5.2007 by Ruben Barkow)


this layout enables you to write complete texts and code only with your left hand, leaves your right hand free for the mouse or numberpad or something else.

TODO:
- define more dead-keys variants
- the keys 'e','n',','and 't' should contain the arrow keys
- the number pad should be changed too
- the capslock key should be changed to a second "ALTGR"
